Description from WP-Cumulus original plugin:

Cumulus allows you to display your site's tags, categories or both using a Flash movie that rotates them in 3D. 

It works just like a regular tags cloud, but is more visually exciting. 

Additional informations:

You must setup getResources or Ditto to show the filtered results.
